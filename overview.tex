\chapter{Introduction}
%===============================================================================



Over the last two decades, there has been a renewed interest in hydrodynamic interactions of droplets or polymers under strong spatial confinement, partially owing to the rapid progress in lab-on-a-chip technology \citep{Squires_Quakes_2005}, partially driven by the fundamental quest after out-of-equilibrium phenomena \citep{Cui_etal_2002, Cui2004, Diamant_2005, tlusty, Davit_2008, q2d_Beatus}, and partially due to its various potential applications in material science and life science \citep{tabeling, organs-on-chips}. The present thesis is largely motivated by the same reasons.

\chapter{Microhydrodynamics}
%===============================================================================


This chapter summarizes the mathematical formulation and theoretical basis of microhydrodynamics and particle interactions.
By \emph{particle}, we loosely mean a solid or liquid body of micron to millimetre in size, which may also be referred to as \emph{droplet} for abuse of language.
As preliminaries, most of the contents below are given without any proof. The interested reader is encouraged to read \cite{Batchelor, hb, ps, kim_karrila, graham_2018} for greater details.

\bigskip

To begin with, recall the incompressible \emph{Navier-Stokes equations}
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:Navier-Sotkes}
 \begin{equation}
   \nabla \cdot {\bm u} = 0,
  \label{eq:div-free}
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
   \rho \bigg(\frac{\partial {\bm u}}{\partial t} + {\bm u} \cdot \nabla {\bm u} \bigg) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla ^2  {\bm u} + {\bm f},
  \label{eq:NS}
 \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
relating the flow velocity $\bm u$ with the pressure $p$ in the presence of some force density $\bm f$, where $\rho$ and $\mu$ are the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid, respectively.
Eqs.\ \eqref{eq:Navier-Sotkes}, together with appropriate boundary conditions, govern the dynamics of a Newtonian fluid that satisfies\footnote{The present thesis only concerns the Newtonian fluid as the solvent, though a particle suspension may exhbit non-Newtonian behaviours as we will see.}
\begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
   {\bm \sigma} = -p {\bm I}+ \mu \bigg( \nabla {\bm u} + (\nabla {\bm u})^T \bigg),
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\bm \sigma$ is the stress tensor, and $\bm I$ the identity matrix.

Depending on the bounding material, conditions on the velocity or stress may be prescribed as boundary conditions. In the case of a solid wall, it is usually the \emph{no-slip} velocity condition; while in the case of a liquid interface, the following stress condition shall be satisfied,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:stress-bc}
  {\bm n} \cdot ({\bm \sigma}_+ - {\bm \sigma}_- )  = \gamma \kappa {\bm n} - \nabla \gamma,
\end{equation}
where $\bm n$ denotes the unit normal vector across the liquid interface (from the $-$ side to the $+$ side), $\gamma$ the surface tension coefficient, and $\kappa$ the curvature of the interface (\eg $\kappa=2/a$ for a sphere of radius $a$). 

Eq.\ \eqref{eq:NS} can be further non-dimensionalized, using the reference length $L$, velocity $U$, time $T$, pressure $P \equiv \mu U/L$, and force density $F \equiv P/L$ scales, into
\begin{equation}
   \textrm{Re} \bigg(\textrm{Sr}^{-1} \frac{\partial \hat{\bm u}}{\partial \hat{t}} + \hat{\bm u} \cdot \hat{\nabla} \hat{\bm u} \bigg) =
   -\hat{\nabla} \hat{p} + \hat{\nabla} ^2  \hat{\bm u} + \hat{\bm f},
  \label{eq:NS-nondi}
\end{equation}
where the hat signifies dimensionless quantities, and Re and Sr represent the \emph{Reynolds} and \emph{Strouhal} numbers, defined as
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \textrm{Re} = \frac{\rho UL}{\mu},\quad \quad \textrm{Sr} = \frac{UT}{L}.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
A capilary number can also be defined to non-dimensionalize the surface tension,
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \textrm{Ca} = \frac{\mu U}{\gamma}.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Stokes flow and its symmetries}
\label{sec:stokes-flows}

When both Re and ReSr$^{-1}$ are small, Eq.\ \eqref{eq:NS-nondi} reduces to the \emph{Stokes equation},
\begin{equation}
   -\nabla p + \mu \nabla ^2  {\bm u} + {\bm f} = {\bm 0},
 \label{eq:Stokes}
\end{equation}
or, equivalently
\begin{equation}
   \nabla \cdot  {\bm \sigma} + {\bm f} = {\bm 0},
 \label{eq:Stokes1}
\end{equation}
which we write in the dimensional form.

Physically, the Stokes equation describes systems that are characterized by small length scales or are in slow motions, which are typically encountered in microfluidic or biological applications.
For instance, the Reynolds number based on a 10 $\mu$m droplet traveling at a speed of 10 $\mu$m/s in water ($\rho=10^3$ kg/m$^{3}$, $\mu=10^{-3}$ Pa$\cdot$s) is $10^{-4}$;
and if there is no imposed frequency, the Strouhal number will be 1.
Manifestly, both Re $\ll 1$ and ReSr$^{-1}$ $\ll 1$ are safely satisfied.

Mathematically, the removal of the nonlinear term in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:NS} dramatically simplifies the solution.
In general, the Stokes flow has the following symmetries and properties.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item \emph{Linearity}, which makes analytical solutions possible in simple cases and the superposition principle applicable in general. For example, if $({\bm u}_1,p_1)$ is a solution to ${\bm f}={\bm f}_1$ and $({\bm u}_2,p_2)$ is a solution to ${\bm f}={\bm f}_2$, then $(\alpha{\bm u}_1+\beta {\bm u}_2,\alpha p_1 + \beta p_2)$ is a solution to ${\bm f}=\alpha{\bm f}_1 + \beta {\bm f}_2$.
 \item \emph{Reversibility}, or \emph{time reversal symmetry}. This is a consequence of the linearity and entails that, if the forcing changes from ${\bm f}$ to $-{\bm f}$, the flow should reverse, \ie $({\bm u},p) \to (-{\bm u},-p)$. While seemingly redundant, the reversibility symmetry can be very powerful in making \emph{reductio ad absurdum} type-of arguments, see \eg the classical note of \cite{Purcell1977}.
 \item \emph{Stress equilibrium}, which states that any force exerted within the fluid is transmitted instantaneously to the boundary or, if there is no boundary, to infinity \citep{graham_2018}.
 \item \emph{Lorentz reciprocal identity}, which relates two solutions, $({\bm u}', {\bm \sigma}')$ and $({\bm u}'', {\bm \sigma}'')$ (they may differ by boundary conditions), of the Stokes equation by,
 \begin{equation}
  \small
  \begin{aligned}
   \int_V \bigg({\bm u}' \cdot (\nabla  \cdot {\bm \sigma}'') - {\bm u}'' \cdot (\nabla  \cdot {\bm \sigma}')\bigg) dV  & =\\
   \int_S \bigg({\bm u}' \cdot ({\bm n} \cdot {\bm \sigma}'') - {\bm u}'' \cdot ({\bm n} \cdot {\bm \sigma}')\bigg) dS, & 
  \end{aligned} \label{eq:lorentz-recip}
 \end{equation}
 where $V$ is some enclosed volume with surface $S$.
 \item \emph{Minimum dissipation principle}. This variational principle asserts that the flow minimizing the energy dissipation rate subject to incompressibility under certain boundary conditions is the Stokes flow under the same boundary conditions.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Single particle in unbounded Stokes flows}
\label{sec:single-p}

When particles are present in a fluid, the coupled dynamics is often significantly more complex than a single phase Stokes flow. Theoretical analyses are thus limited to a handful of simple problems. However, even in a simplified condition, an analytical solution often provides us useful physical intuitions that may be applied to more complicated cases. Below, we list some elementary solutions of the Stokes equation in its simplest setup, \ie a single particle in unbounded Stokes flows.

\bigskip
Imagine the force density ${\bm f}$ in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:Stokes} is singularly supported at the origin, \ie ${\bm f}({\bm x})={\bm F}\delta({\bm x})$, $\delta$ being the Dirac delta. This might represent a reasonable approximation of a small sedimenting particle viewed from a distance. Then, the solution of the Stokes equation due to this forcing can be written as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:stokes-green}
 \begin{aligned}
   {\bm u}({\bm x}) = {\bm G}({\bm x}) \cdot {\bm F},
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where  
\begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
   {\bm G}({\bm x}) = \frac{1}{8\pi\mu } \bigg( \frac{{\bm I}}{\abs{\bm x}}+\frac{ {\bm x}{\bm x} }{ \abs{{\bm x}}^3 } \bigg),
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
is the free-space Green's function, also known as the \emph{Stokeslet} or \emph{Oseen tensor}.

Now, if the particle has a finite radius $a$ and the background fluid has a linear velocity ${\bm u}^\infty$ in the absence of the particle, we can perform a Taylor expansion of $\bm G$ and integrate Eq.\ \eqref{eq:stokes-green} over the particle surface to obtain a solution of the following form (in index notation)\footnote{In this simple example, we require the point ${\bm x}$ to be far from the particle so that the terms involving the Green's function can be taken outside the integral, see \cite{graham_2018}.}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:multipole}
 \begin{aligned}
   {u}_i({\bm x})-{u}_i^\infty({\bm x}) = -{G}_{ij}({\bm x}) {F}_j^{d} + \frac{\partial G_{ij}}{\partial x_l}({\bm x}) {D}_{jl} +
   \mathcal{O}\bigg(\frac{a^3}{\abs{{\bm x}}^3}\bigg),
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where ${\bm F}^{d}$ denotes the total drag force exerted on the particle by the fluid, and ${\bm D}$ is an integral expression representing a force dipole ($\sim {\bm F}{\bm h}$, $\bm h$ being a separation vector).
%\begin{equation} 
% \begin{aligned}
%   {D}_{jl} = \int_{S_p} x'_l n_k \sigma_{kj}({\bm x}') dS({\bm x}').
% \end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
For purposes of analytical calculations, it is customary to decompose ${\bm D}$ into a traceless symmetric part ${\bm S}$, called the \emph{stresslet}, and an antisymmetric part ${\bm R}$, called the \emph{rotlet}, \viz
\begin{subequations}
 \begin{equation}
   {\bm S} = {\bm D}^S - \frac{1}{3} \Tr({\bm D}) {\bm I},
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
  {\bm R} = {\bm D}^A,
 \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
where $D_{ij}^S=(D_{ij}+D_{ji})/2$ and $D_{ij}^A=(D_{ij}-D_{ji})/2$.

The second term on the right-hand side of Eq.\ \eqref{eq:multipole} can then be expressed as
\begin{equation} 
 \begin{aligned}
   \frac{\partial G_{ij}}{\partial x_l}({\bm x}) {D}_{jl} = T_{lij}^{STR}({\bm x}) S_{jl} + T_{lij}^{ROT}({\bm x}) R_{jl},
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{subequations}
 \begin{equation}
   T_{ijk}^{STR}({\bm x}) = -\frac{1}{8\pi\mu} \frac{3x_i x_j x_k}{\abs{{\bm x}}^5},
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
   T_{ijk}^{ROT}({\bm x}) = -\frac{1}{8\pi\mu} \frac{\delta_{jk} x_i - \delta_{ij} x_k}{\abs{{\bm x}}^3}.
 \end{equation}
\end{subequations}

Eq.\ \eqref{eq:multipole} is the \emph{multipole expansion} of the disturbance velocity, ${\bm u}-{\bm u}^\infty$. One immediate physical implication is that a forced particle (\eg a rising bubble) will generate a disturbance that decays as $1/\abs{\bm x}$, while a force-free particle (\eg a self-propelled bacterium) has a $1/\abs{\bm x}^2$ decay thus leaving less trace at the same distance away. See Figure \ref{fig:lets} for illustrations.\footnote{The rotlet flow is simply a rigid-body rotation centered at the origin.}

  \caption{Flow fields due a Stokeslet (left) and a stresslet (right) centered at the origin (red dot). The black arrows display the velocities, while their directions are also indicated by the gray arrows. The flow fields are both axi- and fore-aft symmetric. Note the difference in the velocity magnitude of the two flows.}
  \label{fig:lets}
\end{figure}

Finally, for a sphere of radius $a$, translating with velocity $\bm U$ and rotating with angular velocity $\bm \Omega$, its total drag, torque, and stresslet are given by the \emph{Fax\'{e}n's laws},
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:faxen}
 \begin{equation}
   {\bm F}^{d} = 6\pi\mu a\bigg( (1+\frac{a^2}{6}\nabla^2){\bm u^\infty - {\bm U}} \bigg) ,
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
  {\bm T}^{d} = 8\pi\mu a^3 ({\bm \omega}^\infty - {\bm \Omega}),
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
   {\bm S} = \frac{20}{3}\pi\mu a^3 \bigg( 1+\frac{a^2}{10}\nabla^2 \bigg) {\bm E}^\infty ,
 \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
where $\small {\bm E}^\infty=(\nabla {\bm u}^\infty + (\nabla {\bm u}^\infty)^T)/2$ is the rate-of-strain tensor.


\section{Droplet interactions in shear flows}

The preceding section presents the most basic solutions of the Stokes equation in the presence of one particle.
In practice, however, it is rarely the case particles or droplets exist in isolation.
Particles tend to abound; and they often interact with each other through various types of hydrodynamic or non-hydrodynamic mechanisms, giving rise to a multitude of phenomena in natural or artificial conditions.
For example, soap bubbles are always in a cluster due to the interfacial capillary attraction, while the same underlying principle can be applied to manipulate droplet motions on a surface to aid liquid handling \citep{vapour-sensing}.
To offer at least some partial insights on the hydrodynamics, we highlight recent theoretical developments of droplet interactions in bulk microflows, starting from the simplest case of two particles immersed in unbounded simple shear flows.

\subsection{Pair interactions in unbounded flows}

Among the early studies of suspension hydrodynamics, \cite{batchelor_green_1972} solved completely the dynamics of two rigid spheres of arbitrary sizes subject to a background fluid motion whose velocity at infinity is a linear function of position, \ie
${\bm u}^\infty \sim {\bm E}^\infty \cdot {\bm x} + {\bm \omega}^\infty \times {\bm x}$ as $\abs{{\bm x}} \to \infty$.
The solution entails the relative velocity of the two sphere centers and their force dipole strengths (related to the effective viscosity of the suspension, see Section \ref{sec:sus-rheo}), and is given in terms of several geometric parameters functions of the spheres' relative position and size ratio.
In the special case of two equal-sized spheres suspended in simple shear flows, the relative velocity can be integrated numerically to yield a trajectory map as in Figure \ref{fig:BG-traj}.
Here, two types of trajectories can be identified:
(i) an \emph{open} trajectory where one particle approaches the other particle from one side, overtakes it, and continues in the same direction to infinity; and
(ii) a \emph{closed} trajectory where two particles stay bound and rotate around each other permanently regardless of how far they may separate temporarily.
It was noted by the authors that, under such ideal conditions (\eg smooth particle surface), the separatrix between open and closed trajectories encloses an infinite volume.
Furthermore, if the two particles are once aligned in the flow direction, they will form a closed loop forever.
% or we can call this a naive man's projection of his relationship ;)

\begin{figure}%[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{BG-traj4.pdf}
  \caption{Trajectory map of two equal spheres in unbounded simple shear flows. The dashed circle indicates the reference sphere, while the solid lines depict the relative trajectories of the second sphere in all planes of axisymmetry, which include the shear plane.}
  \label{fig:BG-traj}
\end{figure}

\cite{Zinchenko1983,Zinchenko1984} considered the problem when the two particles are ``fluid spheres''.
Specifically, he calculated the scalar parameters introduced in \cite{batchelor_green_1972} for two identical droplets, and showed that they are functions of the relative position and viscosity ratio, $\lambda$, defined as the ratio between the droplet and the solvent viscosities.
For $\lambda=$ 0.25 to 20, the phase diagram  in simple shear flows has similar topological features to the case of rigid particles,\footnote{Different types of trajectories were also hypothesized, which may only exist in the case of liquid drops. See \cite{Zinchenko1984} for details.} \ie an open region and a closed region, though its asymptotic limit depends on the viscosity ratio and short-range non-hydrodynamic interactions, cf.\ the DLVO theory.

For the above analysis to hold for liquid droplets, an additional constraint must be satisfied, \ie Ca $\ll 1$.
This is usually the case for microfluidic applications. For instance, recall the case considered in the beginning of Section \ref{sec:stokes-flows}, and suppose it is an oil droplet traveling in water under a relatively large local shear rate of $\dot{\gamma}=10^3$ s$^{-1}$. The surface tension coefficient would be around 0.05 N/m, depending on surfactants and the temperature, resulting in Ca $=\mu(a\dot{\gamma})/\gamma \sim 10^{-4}$. Clearly, the capillary number is small enough for the droplet to remain spherical in the flow.

We note that, in both cases, the relative particle velocity is proportional to the shear rate of the underlying flow. That is, doubling the shear will result in twice as fast relative motions between the particles, though the relative velocity remains much smaller than the absolute velocity in the lab frame (typically two orders-of-magnitude smaller). Hence, these are truly slow, but long-range, interactions.

When particles are at close contact, say the surface gap $h \ll a$, with $a$ being the particle radius. Then, the hydrodynamic interaction will be dominated by the lubrication term. Specifically, the lubrication force diverge as $a/h$ in the longitudinal direction, and as $\log(a/h)$ in the transverse directions \citep{jeffrey_onishi_1984}. Qualitatively, lubrication functions as a dashpot that prevents incoming particles from colliding and separating particles from overshooting. These will be further discussed and demonstrated in Section \ref{sec:num-dem} and \emph{Papers 7 \& 8}.


\subsection{Pair interactions under weak confinement}

When boundaries cannot be neglected in a binary encounter, how will the particle interactions be modified from the \cite{batchelor_green_1972} (BG) solution?
Before answering this question, observe that walls may be mathematically replaced with carefully chosen reflection images of the original particles such that the boundary conditions along the walls remain unchanged \citep{blake_1971, LironMochon}.
Therefore, we expect pair interactions in bounded flows to differ qualitatively from the unbouned ones.

Beginning with the simplest case where only one wall is remotely present, \cite{Fouxon_Rubinstein2019} recently derived the relative velocity of two rigid particles as a sum of the BG's velocity and a wall-correction term (\emph{Paper 4}). The solution is constructed from an boundary integral representation of channel flows using multipole expansions similar to Eq.\ \eqref{eq:multipole}, see \cite{Fouxon_2017} (\emph{Paper 3}) for details.
Figure \ref{fig:itzhak-boris} illustrates the main results.
Here, the lines depicts the relative trajectories of the second particle in the shear plane, where the velocity is in the $x$ direction and increases with $z$. The wall is located at $z=-z_0$.
Remarkably, there exist two types of closed trajectories (in blue) and two types of open trajectories (in red).
Close to the origin, a degenerate of the BG-type closed trajectory is singly connected to an open trajectory at an unstable saddle point at distance $r_s$ from the origin.
The latter is not admissible in BG, as the particles swap their $z$ coordinates after a binary encounter rather than returning to the original positions.
Such open trajectories have been previously termed ``swapping trajectories'' and recognized as a wall-induced cross-streamline particle migration mechanism, attributing to the anomalously large self-diffusivity observed in a dilute suspension measurement \citep{Zarraga_Leighton2002, zurita-gotor_2007}.
Our derivation and numerical simulations independently verify this result.

\begin{figure}%[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{itzhak-boris.pdf}
  \caption{
  (left) Trajectory map of two equal spheres in simple shear flows bounded by a distant wall. The distance between the reference particle (located at the origin) and the wall is $z_0=5$ (in units of particle radius, same for the labels of the plot). $r_s$ and $r_c$ denote the saddle point and the neutral equilibrium point, respectively.
  (right) Schematic illustrations of the stationary configuration (upper) and the dancing trajectory (lower).}
  \label{fig:itzhak-boris}
\end{figure}

Extending further away from the reference particle, we identify a new class of closed trajectories along which the second particle rotates around a neural equilibrium center. Note that, despite a distant wall, the trajectories remain axisymmetric with respect to the $x$ axis. Thus, all points on the circle $x^2+y^2=r_c^2$ are stationary configurations.
Slightly moving away from the center point, the second particles will revolve perpectually as it is convected by the flow; hence, we call them the ``dancing trajectories'' (see Figure \ref{fig:itzhak-boris}, right).
The positions of these critical points are approximately related to the wall separation alone. Specifically, $r_s=(32z_0^3/15)^{1/5}$ and $r_c \approx 4z_0$.
Overall, the wall is a singular perturbation to the free-space particle interaction.

\bigskip
Before we proceed to more confined geometries, it may be helpful to reflect on the physcial insights that can be gained from the theoretical analyses.

First, in a dilute suspension of inertialess particles in Stokes flows, up to leading order in the particle-particle and particle-wall separations, the trajectory of one particle is the same as the fluid streamline resulting from the rest of the particle(s)/wall(s). Therefore, a comparison of the particle and fluid velocities has at least a qualitative meaning, or even quantitatively if the separations are large \citep{zurita-gotor_2007}.\footnote{This, of course, will be invalid if there are sufficient symmetry-breaking short-range interactions, see \eg \emph{Paper 2}.}
This can be more readily seen from the opposite statement, \viz if the particle trajectories are available, then the flow field can be qualitatively constructed using the particles as tracers.

\begin{figure}%[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.55\columnwidth]{stresslet_reflection.png}
  \caption{Schematic of the wall reflection of the stresslet flow (cf.\ Figure \ref{fig:lets}) induced by one particle and its qualitative effect on the other particle. Reproduced from \cite{zurita-gotor_2007} (\lb{Permission???}).}
  \label{fig:stresslet-refl}
\end{figure}

Second, the effect of a rigid boundary on particle interactions can sometimes be intuitively predicted by image analyses utilizing basic solutions of the Stokes equation.
For example, \cite{zurita-gotor_2007} performed a relatively simple analysis to explain the flow reversal pattern (\ie the swapping trajectories) by calculating the scattering flow.
As sketched in Figure \ref{fig:stresslet-refl}, the wall reflection of the stresslet flow (since the particles are force-free) produces a vertical velocity component consistent with what is required for the position swapping (see \cite{zurita-gotor_2007} for the detailed calculations). This flow, despite being very small, is what causes the second particle to be shielded from the first one.

Finally, we note that these observed particle interactions may be superimposed pairwise to infer the collective dynamics of a group of particles in similar conditions.
To illustrate this point, we simulated two rigid particles in a periodic channel (thus mimicking a 1D crystal) and observed a crossover from permanent separation of the particle pair (for $0.32 \lessapprox z_0/H \lessapprox 0.68$) to a trapping state (for $z_0/H \lessapprox 0.32$ or $z_0/H \gtrapprox 0.68$), where $H$ is the channel height (same setup and notation otherwise, cf.\ Figures \ref{fig:itzhak-boris} and \ref{fig:stresslet-refl}).
Qualitatively, the former results from cross-stream migrations that resemble the BG open trajectories, while the latter is due to position swappings with neighbouring particles strongly influenced by the wall.
See \cite{Beatus2006, Janssen2012, Uspal2013} for a few more analogous and vivid demonstrations.

For $0.32 \lessapprox z_0/H \lessapprox 0.68$ (only a half plane is shown due to symmetry), the lines diverge (see the right panel) indicating a permanent separation.}

\subsection{Droplet interactions in quasi-two-dimensional geometries}
\label{subsec:drop-confined}

The last two decades has witnessed a significant progress in the physical understanding of spatial confinement on hydrodynamic interactions owing to the development of microfluidics \citep{Cui_etal_2002, Cui2004, tlusty, Davit_2008, q2d_Beatus}. At a first glance, increasing the confinement seems to complicate the analytics as the boundary becomes part of the problem (as opposed to being infinitely away), see \eg \cite{LironMochon, Fouxon_Rubinstein2019}. However, by returning to the physical origin of the equations, one can surprisingly gain a useful insight applicable to a wide range of geometries and particle sizes \citep{Diamant_2005}. Below, we examplify two such conditions, one in which the interacting droplets are confined between two rigid planes, the other between free surfaces. The solutions are simplified by focusing on the far-field interactions and realizing that the problem is \emph{quasi-two-dimensional} (q2D). 

\bigskip
Consider the flow between two paralell plates where the gap $H$ is much smaller than the other two dimensions (say $x$ and $y$); such geometry is commonly known as the \emph{Hele Shaw cell}. Then, from the lubrication theory, the velocity of the flow within the thin layer is approximately prescribed as 
 \begin{equation} \label{eq:hele-shaw}
  \begin{aligned}
    {\bm u}(x,y,z) \approx -\frac{z(H-z)}{2\mu} \nabla p(x,y),
  \end{aligned}
 \end{equation}
where the vertical components of the velocity and pressure are neglected, though ${\bm u}$ remains $z$-dependent. Hence, the flow is quasi-two-dimentional.

Under such conditions, the velocity field is irrotational and satisfies the boundary conditions of zero normal components at a rigid boundary in the horizontal plane \citep{Batchelor}. That is, a moving droplet (shaped as a pancake in q2D) shall have zero mass flux through its edge, not no-slip. With these requirements, it can be shown that the flow, created by the drop far from its surface, is proportional to
%Similar to the derivation for the Stokeslet, the flow ${\bm u}$ due to a moving droplet can be approxmiately derived, which has the following far-field structure
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dipolar}
 \begin{aligned}
   {\bm B}^s({\bm x}) \approx -\frac{\alpha H}{\mu} \bigg( \frac{{\bm I}}{\abs{\bm x}^2} -\frac{ 2{\bm x}{\bm x} }{ \abs{{\bm x}}^4} \bigg),
   \quad \textrm{for} \quad \abs{\bm x} \gg H,
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is a dimensionless prefactor depending on the confinement \citep{Diamant}.

Physically, the above equation describes a 2D \emph{mass dipole} that displaces the surrounding fluid as the droplet moves.
Mathematically, it is the q2D Oseen tensor that approximates the velocity due to forcing on a moving droplet from afar, \ie ${\bm u} \sim {\bm B}{\bm F}$.
Specifically, ${\bm u}$ decays with the distance as $1/\abs{\bm x}^2$, which is faster than the free-space Stokeslet flow, but surprisingly slower than the flow caused by a moving particle near a single plate \citep{Cui2004}.
Heuristic arguments based on conservation laws have been proposed to explain these scaling differences, see \cite{Diamant} for details.

\end{figure}

To see the flow structure more clearly, we plot the dipolar flow resulting from a horizontal force in Figure \ref{fig:q2d} (left).
Here, the most salient feature is the negative transverse coupling of the droplet motion, \ie droplets exert ``antidrag'' on one another when moving perpendicular to their connecting line \citep{Cui2004}.
This pattern, however, can also be reversed if the droplets are driven by the flow. In that case, droplets lagging behind the undisturbed Hele Shaw flow will convey each to downstream directions to which they also travel \citep{Beatus2006}.
%Identification of this dipolar interaction mechanism has led to many microfluidic-based droplet manipulations, see \cite{q2d_Beatus} for a recent review.
%(iii) At large distances, the pair interaction is independent of concentration within the experimental accuracy. 
We note that the magnitude of typical dipolar flows are very small comparing to the driven flow in a dilute suspension. Even in the limit of $a/H \to 0$, where $a$ is the particle radius, the prefactor in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:dipolar} is analytically found to be $\alpha=3/(32\pi)\approx 0.030$ \citep{LironMochon}.
However, if the droplet nearly blocks the channel, the resulting flow will be plug-like and has a constant velocity \citep{q2d_Beatus}.

\bigskip
An interesting variation of the aforementioned q2D system is to change the boundary from solid plates to free surfaces. Physically, this could be realized by trapping colloidal particles within a soap film using optical tweezers \citep{Leonardo_etal_2008}.

The Oseen tensor describing the long-range interactions within such a system is given as \citep{Leonardo_etal_2008, Diamant}
\begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
   {\bm B}^f({\bm x}) \approx \frac{1}{4\pi\mu H} \bigg[ \big( \ln(\nicefrac{1}{\kappa r}) -1 \big) {\bm I} +\frac{{\bm x}{\bm x} }{ \abs{{\bm x}}^2} \bigg],
   \quad \textrm{for} \quad \abs{\bm x} \gg H,
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa^{-1}$ is a cutoff length necessitated by the latteral system size or finite liquid inertia, \ie the radial velocity component vanishes for $\abs{\bm x} \geq \kappa^{-1}$.\footnote{By definition, $\kappa^{-1} \gg H$.}
Upon visualization of the resulting flow field (Figure \ref{fig:q2d}, right), it is obvious that particle interactions have a much longer tail in free-standing liquid films. Furthermore, the transverse motions remain strongly coupled at distances where the longitudinal mode has mostly decayed.
The slow logrithmic decay comparing to the dipolar flow in a Hele Shaw cell is physically owing to the momentum conservations at the liquid boundaries, as opposed to momentum absorption by the rigid plates \citep{Diamant}.
This comparison may bear resemblence to protein transport in biomembranes. \lb{cite someone}

\bigskip
Finally, we emphase that the above analyses are strictly limited to far-field interactions as a consequence of the dimensionality reduction.
To consider near-field interactions, the full Navier-Stokes or Stokes equations may have to be solved to accurately resolve the detailed flow fields near the droplet, see \eg \cite{zhu_gallaire_2016, flow-assist}. 
In general, q2D analyses are applicable if the system contains a limiting length scale smaller than any other relavant distances, and if a long time evolution is of interest.
3D calculations, however inconvenient, cannot be avoided in most other situations.


\section{Suspension rheology}
\label{sec:sus-rheo}

microstructure,
many-body problems (theoretical difficulties),
macroscopic properties, averages and bulk stresses (see Brady and Bossis).

The behaviour of systems involving the motion of small particles relative to a suspending fluid covers a wide range of phenomena of interest to both scientists and engineers. Dense suspensions, where the volume fraction of solid particles becomes comparable to or even higher than that of the fluid (see Figure \ref{fig:snap}), have particularly rich and sometimes unexpected rheologies, such as yielding, shear thinning, continuous shear thickening (CST), or discontinuous shear thickening (DST) \citep{mewis_wagner_book, Morton_Morris_2014, guazzelli_pouliquen_2018, Morris_annurev2020}. Apart from being theoretically intriguing, these complex behaviours often have major implications in practice. For instance, while it makes sense for the cement industry to manufacture suspensions that do not shear thicken, the same feature becomes an advantage for designing flexible body armor.

limitation of theoretical approaches,
necessity of numerical solutions.

Despite the practical importance, theoretical development of suspension rheology remains chanllenging and only a few analytical solutions have been found in the dilute regime, see \eg \cite{Einstein_1906, batchelor_green_1972b}. This is partially due to a lack of precise knowledge or control of various interactions at the particle level, partially due to the mathematical difficulties involved in many-body problems. On the other hand, solving a system of interacting particles is relatively straightforward in an algorithmic perspective. In fact, the last decades have seen tremendous advancement in both numerical simulations and computer hardware.

\section{Particle-based methods}
\label{sec:num-dem}

The central equation to solve is
\begin{equation} 
 \begin{aligned} \label{eq:force-balance}
  {\bm m} \cdot \frac{d{\bm U}}{dt} = {\bm F}^H + {\bm F}^P, 
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where ${\bm m}$ is a generalized mass/moment-of-inertia matrix of dimension $6N \times 6N$,
${\bm U}$ is the particle translational/rotational velocity vector of dimension $6N$,
and ${\bm F}$ represent the $6N$ force/torque vectors owing to hydrodynamics (denoted with superscript $\footnotesize H$) or other interactions (denoted with superscript $\footnotesize P$). Specifically, ${\bm F}^P$ may include contact, electrostatic, van der Waars, or magnetic forces, \etc. In principle, stochastic forces can also be included in the general formulation, though its numerical treatments demand special care such that fluctuation-dissipation theorem is satified. In the present thesis, Brownian motions are neglected.

For inertialess particles in Stokes flow, the task is to solve Eq.\ \eqref{eq:force-balance} subject to ${\bm m} \cdot (d{\bm U}/dt) \to 0$. Various techniques exist as summarized below.

\subsection{Stokesian dynamics}

The Stokesian dynamics \citep{Brady_Bossis1988} employs the fact that, when the particle Reynolds number is small and the bulk flow is linear, the hydrodynamic forces and stresses exerted on the particles by the fluid can be expressed as
\begin{equation} 
 \begin{aligned} \label{eq:sd-hydro}
  \begin{pmatrix}
   {\bm F}^H \\
   {\bm S}^H
  \end{pmatrix}
  = - \mathscr{R} \cdot
  \begin{pmatrix}
   {\bm U}-{\bm U}^\infty \\
   -{\bm E}^\infty
  \end{pmatrix},
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation} 
 \begin{aligned}
  \mathscr{R} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
   {\bm R}_{FU} & {\bm R}_{FE} \\
   {\bm R}_{SU} & {\bm R}_{SE}
  \end{pmatrix},
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
is termed the ``grand resistance'' matrix. 
If $\mathscr{R}$ is known, 
formulate the problem as

It is calculated as
\begin{equation} 
 \begin{aligned}
  \mathscr{R} = (\mathscr{M}^\infty)^{-1} +\mathscr{R}_{2B} - \mathscr{R}_{2B}^\infty.
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}          
Es.\ \eqref{eq:sd-hydro} is then inverted and integrated in time to obtain the dynamics.
