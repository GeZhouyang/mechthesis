\begin{abstract}
Micron to millimetre sized droplets, precisely generated or sustained in controlled environment, have great potential in engineering applications
functioning as the basic element to assemble metamaterials, deliver drugs, host surfactant, reduce friction, and damp turbulence.
The interaction of droplets from pairwise to collective levels is the most important factor in controlling these processes,
yet little is known about the detailed mechanisms in various nonideal conditions.
The present thesis combines a number of studies aiming to elucidate the physical principles of droplet interactions and suspension flow
using both high- and low-fidelity numerical simulations.

We first study flow-assisted droplet assembly in microfluidic channels, seeking to harness the droplet interactions to produce photonic bandgap materials.
A novel interface-correction level set/ghost fluid method (ICLS/GFM) is developed to directly simulate liquid droplets under depletion forces.
Comparing to previous methods, ICLS/GFM conserves the global mass of each fluid using a simple mass-correction scheme,
accurately computes the surface tension and depletion forces under the same framework,
and has subsequently been applied to investigate the droplet clustering observed in a microfluidic experiment.
Our simulations, supported by theoretical derivations, suggest that the combined effects of
strong depletion forces, confinement-mediated shear alignments, and fine-tuned inflow conditions
are responsible for the observed fast self-assembly.
However, the interplay of these 3D effects negates a simple parametric model of the droplet interaction,
rendering the fabrication of photonic crystals based on flow-assisted assembly suboptimal in practice.

The next focus of the thesis is the implementation of a minimal discrete-element lubrication/contact dynamics (DLCD) model for simulation of dense particle suspensions.
The main ingredients include a frame-invariant, short-range lubrication model for spherical particles,
and a soft-core, stick/slide frictional contact model activated when particles overlap.
However, since contact interactions dominate at high particle concentrations,
we expect the present methodology to be applicable for studying the jamming and rheology of non-spherical particles or foams as well.

Finally, we include two miscellaneous studies concerning
the effective slip and robustness of liquid-infused surfaces and statistics of droplets in a homogeneous turbulent shear flow.
Overall, results of these simulations provide detailed flow visualisations and qualitative dependence of the target functional on various governing parameters,
facilitating experimental and theoretical investigations to design more robust drag-reducing surfaces and predict the mixing of emulsions.

\begin{preface}
	This thesis summarizes a selection of studies on droplet interactions and suspension flow
        that may find applications in microfluidics, soft matter, and rheology.
        A brief introduction of the basic physical concepts and numerical methods is presented in Part I,
        followed by seven journal articles or preprints in Part II, see below.
        For consistency, all papers are formatted in the \texttt{jfm} style as the rest of the thesis.
        Their contents remain faithful to the original publications.
