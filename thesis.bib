abstract = "An immersed boundary method (IBM) with second-order spatial accuracy is presented for fully resolved simulations of incompressible viscous flows laden with rigid particles. The method is based on the computationally efficient direct-forcing method of Uhlmann [M. Uhlmann, An immersed boundary method with direct forcing for simulation of particulate flows, J. Comput. Phys. 209 (2005) 448–476] that is embedded in a finite-volume/pressure-correction method. The IBM consists of two grids: a fixed uniform Eulerian grid for the fluid phase and a uniform Lagrangian grid attached to and moving with the particles. A regularized delta function is used to communicate between the two grids and proved to be effective in suppressing grid locking. Without significant loss of efficiency, the original method is improved by: (1) a better approximation of the no-slip/no-penetration (ns/np) condition on the surface of the particles by a multidirect forcing scheme, (2) a correction for the excess in the effective particle diameter by a slight retraction of the Lagrangian grid from the surface towards the interior of the particles with a fraction of the Eulerian grid spacing, and (3) an enhancement of the numerical stability for particle–fluid mass density ratios near unity by a direct account of the inertia of the fluid contained within the particles. The new IBM contains two new parameters: the number of iterations Ns of the multidirect forcing scheme and the retraction distance rd. The effect of Ns and rd on the accuracy is investigated for five different flows. The results show that rd has a strong influence on the effective particle diameter and little influence on the error in the ns/np condition, while exactly the opposite holds for Ns. A novel finding of this study is the demonstration that rd has a strong influence on the order of grid convergence. It is found that for spheres the choice of rd=0.3Δx yields second-order accuracy compared to first-order accuracy of the original method that corresponds to rd=0. Finally, Ns=2 appears optimal for reducing the error in the ns/np condition and maintaining the computational efficiency of the method."

abstract = "We review non-equilibrium many-body phenomena in ensembles of 2D microfluidic droplets. The system comprises of continuous two-phase flow with disc-shaped droplets driven in a channel, at low Reynolds number of 10−4–10−3. The basic physics is that of an effective potential flow, governed by the 2D Laplace equation, with multiple, static and dynamic, boundaries of the droplets and the walls. The motion of the droplets induces dipolar flow fields, which mediate 1/r2 hydrodynamic interaction between the droplets. Summation of these long-range 2D forces over droplet ensembles converges, in contrast to the divergence of the hydrodynamic forces in 3D. In analogy to electrostatics, the strong effect of boundaries on the equations of motion is calculated by means of image dipoles. We first consider the dynamics of droplets flowing in a 1D crystal, which exhibits unique phonon-like excitations, and a variety of nonlinear instabilities—all stemming from the hydrodynamic interactions. Narrowing the channel results in hydrodynamic screening of the dipolar interactions, which changes salient features of the phonon spectra. Shifting from a 1D ordered crystal to 2D disordered ensemble, the hydrodynamic interactions induce collective density waves and shocks, which are superposed on single-droplet randomized motion and dynamic clustering. These collective modes originate from density–velocity coupling, whose outcome is a 1D Burgers equation. The rich observational phenomenology and the tractable theory render 2D droplet ensembles a suitable table-top system for studying non-equilibrium many-body physics with long-range interactions."

abstract = "Dynamic simulation of pressure-driven flow of a non-neutrally buoyant suspension has been performed by Stokesian Dynamics. Channel flow at zero Reynolds number of a monodisperse non-Brownian suspension of spheres in a monolayer was studied for a range of three parameters: bulk particle area fraction ΦAb dimensionless gravitational parameter B = (U0/〈u〉(Ha)2, and dimensionless channel width Ha. Here, U0 is the Stokes settling velocity of an isolated sphere, 〈u〉 is the mean velocity of the suspension, H is the channel width, and a is the particle radius. From an initially uniform distribution, a range of behavior in the fully-developed flow is observed depending upon the value of B. For small B, shear-induced migration dominates buoyancy effects, and a layer at large ΦA is formed in the center of the channel. For sufficiently strong gravitation, particles settle rapidly to form a concentrated layer that is transported along the bottom of the channel by shearing. At intermediate values of B, shear-induced migration of particles to the center of the channel occurs simultaneously with gravitational settling. In the lower portion of the channel, these fluxes are opposed and lead to nonmonotonic variation of particle fraction, with ΦA increasing away from the lower wall to a maximum near or even above the centerline and then rapidly decreasing, typically vanishing to leave clear fluid adjacent to the upper wall. These results are in qualitative agreement with the small amount of experimental data in the literature on such systems. The flow has been modeled using macroscopic balance equations presented previously; the predictions agree well with simulations."

In the course of the study, we observe spontaneous alignment of droplet pairs, pair exchanges, droplet escape, multiple reflections between walls, i.e., a number of phenomena that have not been reported yet. As a whole, using pairwise far-field dipolar interactions between droplets, along with treating the walls as mirrors, allows to reproduce the observations, even though limitations in the predictability of the model are pointed out in a few cases. From a more practical prospective, the work shows that the behavior of elementary droplet assemblies can be put under acceptable experimental control in a wide variety of situations, a feature potentially interesting for self-assembly, mixing, or transport of particles in microfluidic environments.",

Here, a microfluidic method for designing building blocks one by one, at high throughput, with a broad range of shapes is introduced. The method exploits a coupling between hydrodynamic interactions and depletion forces that controls the configurational dynamics of droplet clusters traveling in microfluidic channels. Droplet clusters can be solidified in situ with UV. By varying the flow parameters, clusters are prescribed a given size, geometry, chemical and/or magnetic heterogeneities enabling local bonding. Compact structures (chains, triangles, diamonds, tetrahedrons,...) and noncompact structures, such as crosses and T, difficult to obtain with current techniques are produced. Size dispersions are small (2\%) and throughputs are high (30 000 h−1). The work opens a new pathway, based on microfluidics, for designing colloidal building blocks with a potential to enable the creation of new materials.},

The infinite series solution is especially suitable for computation purposes being an exponentially decreasing series. From the series the ``far field'' behaviour is extracted. It is found that a force singularity parallel to the two planes has a far field behaviour of source and image for the parallel components (a two dimensional source doublet of height-dependent strength) whereas the normal component, and all fields due to a force singularity normal to the planes, die out exponentially. Velocity fields are compared with those of the one plane case. An estimate of the influence of the second wall and when its effect can be disregarded is obtained.",

A regularized delta function is used to communicate between the two grids and proved to be effective in suppressing grid locking. Without significant loss of efficiency, the original method is improved by: (1) a better approximation of the no-slip/no-penetration (ns/np) condition on the surface of the particles by a multidirect forcing scheme, (2) a correction for the excess in the effective particle diameter by a slight retraction of the Lagrangian grid from the surface towards the interior of the particles with a fraction of the Eulerian grid spacing, and (3) an enhancement of the numerical stability for particle–fluid mass density ratios near unity by a direct account of the inertia of the fluid contained within the particles. The new IBM contains two new parameters: the number of iterations Ns of the multidirect forcing scheme and the retraction distance rd. The effect of Ns and rd on the accuracy is investigated for five different flows. The results show that rd has a strong influence on the effective particle diameter and little influence on the error in the ns/np condition, while exactly the opposite holds for Ns. A novel finding of this study is the demonstration that rd has a strong influence on the order of grid convergence. It is found that for spheres the choice of rd=0.3Δx yields second-order accuracy compared to first-order accuracy of the original method that corresponds to rd=0. Finally, Ns=2 appears optimal for reducing the error in the ns/np condition and maintaining the computational efficiency of the method."
