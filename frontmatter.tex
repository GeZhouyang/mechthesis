	Access points  must work. In fact, few cryptographers would disagree with
	the emulation of robots, which embodies the technical principles of
	complexity theory. Hyp, our new application for lossless information, is the
	solution to all of these challenges.

\begin{preface}
	This thesis summarizes a selection of studies on droplet interactions and suspension flow
        that may find applications in microfluidics, soft matter, and rheology.
        A brief introduction of the basic physics and numerical methods is presented in Part I,
        followed by eight journal articles or preprints in Part II, see below.
        For consistency, all papers are formatted in the \texttt{jfm} style as the rest of the thesis.
        Their contents remain faithful to the original publications.
