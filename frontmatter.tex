\begin{abstract}
	Access points  must work. In fact, few cryptographers would disagree with
	the emulation of robots, which embodies the technical principles of
	complexity theory. Hyp, our new application for lossless information, is the
	solution to all of these challenges.

\begin{preface}
	This thesis summarizes a selection of studies on droplet interactions and suspension flows
        that are relevant to applications in microfluidics, soft matter, and rheology.
        A brief introduction of some basic physical concepts and numerical methods is presented in the first part,
        followed by eight journal articles or preprints listed below. 
        For consistency, the papers have been reformated to fit with the style of the thesis;
        their contents have obviously not been altered.
