\chapter{Microhydrodynamics}
%===============================================================================


This chapter summarizes the mathematical formulation and theoretical basis of microhydrodynamics and particle interactions.
By \emph{particle}, we loosely mean a solid or liquid body of micron to millimetre in size, which may also be referred to as \emph{droplet} for abuse of language.
As preliminaries, most of the contents below are given without any proof. The interested reader is encouraged to read \cite{Batchelor, hb, ps, kim_karrila, graham_2018} for greater details.

\bigskip

To begin with, recall the incompressible \emph{Navier-Stokes equations}
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:Navier-Sotkes}
 \begin{equation}
   \nabla \cdot {\bm u} = 0,
  \label{eq:div-free}
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
   \rho \bigg(\frac{\partial {\bm u}}{\partial t} + {\bm u} \cdot \nabla {\bm u} \bigg) = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla ^2  {\bm u} + {\bm f},
  \label{eq:NS}
 \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
relating the flow velocity $\bm u$ with the pressure $p$ in the presence of some force density $\bm f$, where $\rho$ and $\mu$ are the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid, respectively.
Eqs.\ \eqref{eq:Navier-Sotkes}, together with appropriate boundary conditions, govern the dynamics of a Newtonian fluid that satisfies\footnote{The present thesis only concerns the Newtonian fluid as the solvent, though a particle suspension may exhbit non-Newtonian behaviours as we will see.}
\begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
   {\bm \sigma} = -p {\bm I}+ \mu \bigg( \nabla {\bm u} + (\nabla {\bm u})^T \bigg),
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\bm \sigma$ is the stress tensor, and $\bm I$ the identity matrix.

Depending on the bounding material, conditions on the velocity or stress may be prescribed as boundary conditions. In the case of a solid wall, it is usually the \emph{no-slip} velocity condition; while in the case of a liquid interface, the following stress condition shall be satisfied,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:stress-bc}
  {\bm n} \cdot ({\bm \sigma}_+ - {\bm \sigma}_- )  = \gamma \kappa {\bm n} - \nabla \gamma,
\end{equation}
where $\bm n$ denotes the unit normal vector across the liquid interface (from the $-$ side to the $+$ side), $\gamma$ the surface tension coefficient, and $\kappa$ the curvature of the interface (\eg $\kappa=2/a$ for a sphere of radius $a$). 

Eq.\ \eqref{eq:NS} can be further non-dimensionalized, using the reference length $L$, velocity $U$, time $T$, pressure $P \equiv \mu U/L$, and force density $F \equiv P/L$ scales, into
\begin{equation}
   \textrm{Re} \bigg(\textrm{Sr}^{-1} \frac{\partial \hat{\bm u}}{\partial \hat{t}} + \hat{\bm u} \cdot \hat{\nabla} \hat{\bm u} \bigg) =
   -\hat{\nabla} \hat{p} + \hat{\nabla} ^2  \hat{\bm u} + \hat{\bm f},
  \label{eq:NS-nondi}
\end{equation}
where the hat signifies dimensionless quantities, and Re and Sr represent the \emph{Reynolds} and \emph{Strouhal} numbers, defined as
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \textrm{Re} = \frac{\rho UL}{\mu},\quad \quad \textrm{Sr} = \frac{UT}{L}.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
A capilary number can also be defined to non-dimensionalize the surface tension,
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \textrm{Ca} = \frac{\mu U}{\gamma}.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Stokes flow and its symmetries}
\label{sec:stokes-flows}

When both Re and ReSr$^{-1}$ are small, Eq.\ \eqref{eq:NS-nondi} reduces to the \emph{Stokes equation},
\begin{equation}
   -\nabla p + \mu \nabla ^2  {\bm u} + {\bm f} = {\bm 0},
 \label{eq:Stokes}
\end{equation}
or, equivalently
\begin{equation}
   \nabla \cdot  {\bm \sigma} + {\bm f} = {\bm 0},
 \label{eq:Stokes1}
\end{equation}
which we write in the dimensional form.

Physically, the Stokes equation describes systems that are characterized by small length scales or are in slow motions, which are typically encountered in microfluidic or biological applications.
For instance, the Reynolds number based on a 10 $\mu$m droplet traveling at a speed of 10 $\mu$m/s in water ($\rho=10^3$ kg/m$^{3}$, $\mu=10^{-3}$ Pa$\cdot$s) is $10^{-4}$;
and if there is no imposed frequency, the Strouhal number will be 1.
Clearly, both Re $\ll 1$ and ReSr$^{-1}$ $\ll 1$ are safely satisfied.

Mathematically, the removal of the nonlinear term in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:NS} dramatically simplifies the solution.
In general, the Stokes flow has the following symmetries and properties.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item \emph{Linearity}, which makes analytical solutions possible in simple cases and the superposition principle applicable in general. For example, if $({\bm u}_1,p_1)$ is a solution to ${\bm f}={\bm f}_1$ and $({\bm u}_2,p_2)$ is a solution to ${\bm f}={\bm f}_2$, then $(\alpha{\bm u}_1+\beta {\bm u}_2,\alpha p_1 + \beta p_2)$ is a solution to ${\bm f}=\alpha{\bm f}_1 + \beta {\bm f}_2$.
 \item \emph{Reversibility}, or \emph{time reversal symmetry}. This is a consequence of the linearity and entails that, if the forcing changes from ${\bm f}$ to $-{\bm f}$, the flow should reverse, \ie $({\bm u},p) \to (-{\bm u},-p)$. While seemingly redundant, the reversibility symmetry can be very powerful in making \emph{reductio ad absurdum} type-of arguments, see \eg the classical note of \cite{Purcell1977}.
 \item \emph{Stress equilibrium}, which states that any force exerted within the fluid is transmitted instantaneously to the boundary or, if there is no boundary, to infinity \citep{graham_2018}.
 \item \emph{Lorentz reciprocal identity}, which relates two solutions, $({\bm u}', {\bm \sigma}')$ and $({\bm u}'', {\bm \sigma}'')$ (they may differ by boundary conditions), of the Stokes equation by,
 \begin{equation}
  \small
  \begin{aligned}
   \int_V \bigg({\bm u}' \cdot (\nabla  \cdot {\bm \sigma}'') - {\bm u}'' \cdot (\nabla  \cdot {\bm \sigma}')\bigg) dV  & =\\
   \int_S \bigg({\bm u}' \cdot ({\bm n} \cdot {\bm \sigma}'') - {\bm u}'' \cdot ({\bm n} \cdot {\bm \sigma}')\bigg) dS, & 
  \end{aligned} \label{eq:lorentz-recip}
 \end{equation}
 where $V$ is some enclosed volume with surface $S$.
 \item \emph{Minimum dissipation principle}. This variational principle asserts that the flow minimizing the energy dissipation rate subject to incompressibility under certain boundary conditions is the Stokes flow under the same boundary conditions.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Single particle in unbounded Stokes flows}

When particles are present in a fluid, the coupled dynamics is often significantly more complex than a single phase Stokes flow. Theoretical analyses are thus limited to a handful of simple problems. However, even in a simplified condition, an analytical solution can often provide us useful physical intuitions that may be applied to more complicated cases. Below, we list some elementary solutions of the Stokes equation in the simplest condition, \ie a single particle in unbounded Stokes flows.

\bigskip
Imagine the force density ${\bm f}$ in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:Stokes} is singularly supported at the origin, \ie ${\bm f}({\bm x})={\bm F}\delta({\bm x})$, $\delta$ being the Dirac delta, which might be a reasonable approximation to a small sedimenting particle viewed from a distance. Then, the solution of the Stokes equation due to this forcing can be written as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:stokes-green}
 \begin{aligned}
   {\bm u}({\bm x}) = {\bm G}({\bm x}) \cdot {\bm F},
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where  
\begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
   {\bm G}({\bm x}) = \frac{1}{8\pi\mu } \bigg( \frac{{\bm I}}{\abs{\bm x}}+\frac{ {\bm x}{\bm x} }{ \abs{{\bm x}}^3 } \bigg),
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
is the free-space Green's function, also known as the \emph{Stokeslet}.

Now, if the particle has a finite radius $a$ and the background fluid has a linear velocity ${\bm u}^\infty$ in the absence of the particle, we can perform a Taylor expansion of $\bm G$ and integrate Eq.\ \eqref{eq:stokes-green} over the particle surface to obtain a solution of the following form (in index notation)\footnote{In this simple example, we require the point ${\bm x}$ to be far from the particle so that the terms involving the Green's function can be taken outside the integral, see \cite{graham_2018}.}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:multipole}
 \begin{aligned}
   {u}_i({\bm x})-{u}_i^\infty({\bm x}) = -{G}_{ij}({\bm x}) {F}_j^{d} + \frac{\partial G_{ij}}{\partial x_l}({\bm x}) {D}_{jl} +
   \mathcal{O}\bigg(\frac{a^3}{\abs{{\bm x}}^3}\bigg),
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where ${\bm F}^{d}$ denotes the total drag force exerted on the particle by the fluid, and ${\bm D}$ is an integral expression representing a force dipole ($\sim {\bm F}{\bm h}$, $\bm h$ being a separation vector).
%\begin{equation} 
% \begin{aligned}
%   {D}_{jl} = \int_{S_p} x'_l n_k \sigma_{kj}({\bm x}') dS({\bm x}').
% \end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
For purposes of analytical calculations, it is customary to decompose ${\bm D}$ into a traceless symmetric part ${\bm S}$, called the \emph{stresslet}, and an antisymmetric part ${\bm R}$, called the \emph{rotlet}, \viz
\begin{subequations}
 \begin{equation}
   {\bm S} = {\bm D}^S - \frac{1}{3} \Tr({\bm D}) {\bm I},
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
  {\bm R} = {\bm D}^A,
 \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
where $D_{ij}^S=(D_{ij}+D_{ji})/2$ and $D_{ij}^A=(D_{ij}-D_{ji})/2$.

The second term on the right-hand side of Eq.\ \eqref{eq:multipole} can then be expressed as
\begin{equation} 
 \begin{aligned}
   \frac{\partial G_{ij}}{\partial x_l}({\bm x}) {D}_{jl} = T_{lij}^{STR}({\bm x}) S_{jl} + T_{lij}^{ROT}({\bm x}) R_{jl},
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{subequations}
 \begin{equation}
   T_{ijk}^{STR}({\bm x}) = -\frac{1}{8\pi\mu} \frac{3x_i x_j x_k}{\abs{{\bm x}}^5},
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
   T_{ijk}^{ROT}({\bm x}) = -\frac{1}{8\pi\mu} \frac{\delta_{jk} x_i - \delta_{ij} x_k}{\abs{{\bm x}}^3}.
 \end{equation}
\end{subequations}

Eq.\ \eqref{eq:multipole} is the \emph{multipole expansion} of the disturbance velocity, ${\bm u}-{\bm u}^\infty$. One immediate physical implication is that a forced particle (\eg a rising bubble) will generate a disturbance that decays as $1/\abs{\bm x}$, while a force-free particle (\eg a self-propelled bacterium) has a $1/\abs{\bm x}^2$ decay thus leaving less trace at the same distance away. See Figure \ref{fig:lets} for illustrations.\footnote{The rotlet flow is simply a rigid-body rotation centered at the origin.}

  \caption{Flow fields due a Stokeslet (left) and a stresslet (right) centered at the origin (red dot). The black arrows display the velocities, while their directions are also indicated by the gray arrows. The flow fields are both axi- and fore-aft symmetric. Note the difference in the velocity magnitude of the two flows.}
  \label{fig:lets}
\end{figure}

Finally, for a sphere of radius $a$, translating with velocity $\bm U$ and rotating with angular velocity $\bm \Omega$, its total drag, torque, and stresslet are given by the \emph{Fax\'{e}n's laws},
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:faxen}
 \begin{equation}
   {\bm F}^{d} = 6\pi\mu a\bigg( (1+\frac{a^2}{6}\nabla^2){\bm u^\infty - {\bm U}} \bigg) ,
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
  {\bm T}^{d} = 8\pi\mu a^3 ({\bm \omega}^\infty - {\bm \Omega}),
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
   {\bm S} = \frac{20}{3}\pi\mu a^3 \bigg( 1+\frac{a^2}{10}\nabla^2 \bigg) {\bm E}^\infty ,
 \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
where $\small {\bm E}^\infty=(\nabla {\bm u}^\infty + (\nabla {\bm u}^\infty)^T)/2$ is the rate-of-strain tensor.


\section{Droplet interactions in shear flows}

The preceding section presents the most basic solutions of the Stokes equation in the presence of only one particle.
In practice, however, it is rarely the case particles or droplets exist in isolation.
Particles tend to abound; and they often interact with each other through various types of hydrodynamic or non-hydrodynamic mechanisms, giving rise to a multitude of phenomena in natural or artificial conditions.
For example, soap bubbles are always in a cluster due to the interfacial capillary attraction, while the same underlying principle can be applied to manipulate droplet motions on a surface to aid liquid handling \citep{vapour-sensing}.
To offer at least some partial insights on the hydrodynamics, we highlight recent theoretical development of droplet interactions in bulk microflows, starting from the simplest case of two particles immersed in unbounded simple shear flows.

\subsection{Pair interactions in unbounded flows}

Among the early studies of suspension hydrodynamics, \cite{batchelor_green_1972} solved completely the dynamics of two rigid spheres of arbitrary sizes subject to a background fluid motion whose velocity at infinity is a linear function of position, \ie
${\bm u}^\infty \sim {\bm E}^\infty \cdot {\bm x} + {\bm \omega}^\infty \times {\bm x}$ as $\abs{{\bm x}} \to \infty$.
The solution entails the relative velocity of the two sphere centers and their force dipole strengths (related to the effective viscosity of the suspension, see Section \ref{sec:sus-rheo}), and is given in terms of several geometric parameters functions of the spheres' relative position and size ratio.
In the special case of two equal-sized spheres suspended in simple shear flows, the relative velocity can be integrated numerically to yield a trajectory diagram as in Figure \ref{fig:BG-traj}.
Here, two types of trajectories can be observed:
(i) an \emph{open} trajectory where one particle approaches the other particle from one side, overtakes it, and continues in the same direction to infinity; and
(ii) a \emph{closed} trajectory where two particles stay bound and rotate around each other permanently regardless of how far they may separate temporarily.
It was noted by the authors that, under such ideal conditions (\eg smooth particle surface), the separatrix between open and closed trajectories encloses an infinite volume.
Furthermore, if the two particles are once aligned in the flow direction, they will form a closed loop forever.
% or we can call this a naive man's projection of his relationship ;)

\begin{figure}%[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{BG-traj4.pdf}
  \caption{Trajectory map of two equal spheres in unbounded simple shear flows. The dashed circle indicates the reference sphere, while the solid lines depict the relative trajectories of the second sphere in all planes of axisymmetry, which include the shear plane.}
  \label{fig:BG-traj}
\end{figure}

\cite{Zinchenko1983,Zinchenko1984} considered the problem when the two particles are ``fluid spheres''.
Specifically, he calculated the scalar parameters introduced in \cite{batchelor_green_1972} for two identical droplets, and showed that they are functions of the relative position and viscosity ratio, $\lambda$, defined as the ratio between the droplet and the solvent viscosities.
For $\lambda=$ 0.25 to 20, the trajectory map in simple shear flows has similar topological features to the case of rigid particles,\footnote{Different types of trajectories were also hypothesized, which may only exist in the case of liquid drops. See \cite{Zinchenko1984} for details.} \ie an open region and a closed region, though its asymptotic limit depends on the viscosity ratio and short-range non-hydrodynamic interactions, cf.\ the DLVO theory.

We note that, in both cases, the relative particle velocity is proportional to the shear rate of the underlying flow.
That is, doubling the shear will result in twice as fast relative motion between the particles, though the relative velocity remains much smaller than the absolute velocity in the lab frame (typically two orders-of-magnitude smaller).
Hence, these are truly slow, but long-range, interactions.
In the case of liquid droplets, an additional constraint needs to be satisfied for the above analysis to hold, \ie Ca $\ll 1$.
This is usually the case for microfluidic applications.
Following the same example as considered in Section \ref{sec:stokes-flows}, and suppose it is an oil droplet traveling in water (the surface tension coefficient would be around 0.05 N/m, depending on surfactants and the temperature) under a relatively large shear rate of $10^3$ s$^{-1}$, then Ca $\sim 10^{-4}$, which is small enough for the droplet to remain spherical in the flow.

With a distant wall, we show possibility of a stationary position.

Here the wall can be considered as the third particle.
note the fact that the rate is very slow, since the relative velocity is small.

\section{Suspension rheology}
\label{sec:sus-rheo}

microstructure,
many-body problems (theoretical difficulties),
macroscopic properties, averages and bulk stresses (see Brady and Bossis).

The behaviour of systems involving the motion of small particles relative to a suspending fluid covers a wide range of phenomena of interest to both scientists and engineers. Dense suspensions, where the volume fraction of solid particles becomes comparable to or even higher than that of the fluid (see Figure \ref{fig:snap}), have particularly rich and sometimes unexpected rheologies, such as yielding, shear thinning, continuous shear thickening (CST), or discontinuous shear thickening (DST) \citep{mewis_wagner_book, Morton_Morris_2014, guazzelli_pouliquen_2018, Morris_annurev2020}. Apart from being theoretically intriguing, these complex behaviours often have major implications in practice. For instance, while it makes sense for the cement industry to manufacture suspensions that do not shear thicken, the same feature becomes an advantage for designing flexible body armor.

limitation of theoretical approaches,
necessity of numerical solutions.

Despite the practical importance, theoretical development of suspension rheology remains chanllenging and only a few analytical solutions have been found in the dilute regime, see \eg \cite{Einstein_1906, batchelor_green_1972b}. This is partially due to a lack of precise knowledge or control of various interactions at the particle level, partially due to the mathematical difficulties involved in many-body problems. On the other hand, solving a system of interacting particles is relatively straightforward in an algorithmic perspective. In fact, the last decades have seen tremendous advancement in both numerical simulations and computer hardware.

\section{Particle-based methods}

The central equation to solve is
\begin{equation} 
 \begin{aligned} \label{eq:force-balance}
  {\bm m} \cdot \frac{d{\bm U}}{dt} = {\bm F}^H + {\bm F}^P, 
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where ${\bm m}$ is a generalized mass/moment-of-inertia matrix of dimension $6N \times 6N$,
${\bm U}$ is the particle translational/rotational velocity vector of dimension $6N$,
and ${\bm F}$ represent the $6N$ force/torque vectors owing to hydrodynamics (denoted with superscript $\footnotesize H$) or other interactions (denoted with superscript $\footnotesize P$). Specifically, ${\bm F}^P$ may include contact, electrostatic, van der Waars, or magnetic forces, \etc. In principle, stochastic forces can also be included in the general formulation, though its numerical treatments demand special care such that fluctuation-dissipation theorem is satified. In the present thesis, Brownian motions are neglected.

For inertialess particles in Stokes flow, the task is to solve Eq.\ \eqref{eq:force-balance} subject to ${\bm m} \cdot (d{\bm U}/dt) \to 0$. Various techniques exist as summarized below.

\subsection{Stokesian dynamics}

The Stokesian dynamics \citep{Brady_Bossis1988} employs the fact that, when the particle Reynolds number is small and the bulk flow is linear, the hydrodynamic forces and stresses exerted on the particles by the fluid can be expressed as
\begin{equation} 
 \begin{aligned} \label{eq:sd-hydro}
  \begin{pmatrix}
   {\bm F}^H \\
   {\bm S}^H
  \end{pmatrix}
  = - \mathscr{R} \cdot
  \begin{pmatrix}
   {\bm U}-{\bm U}^\infty \\
   -{\bm E}^\infty
  \end{pmatrix},
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation} 
 \begin{aligned}
  \mathscr{R} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
   {\bm R}_{FU} & {\bm R}_{FE} \\
   {\bm R}_{SU} & {\bm R}_{SE}
  \end{pmatrix},
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
is termed the ``grand resistance'' matrix. 
If $\mathscr{R}$ is known, 
formulate the problem as

It is calculated as
\begin{equation} 
 \begin{aligned}
  \mathscr{R} = (\mathscr{M}^\infty)^{-1} +\mathscr{R}_{2B} - \mathscr{R}_{2B}^\infty.
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}          
Es.\ \eqref{eq:sd-hydro} is then inverted and integrated in time to obtain the dynamics.
