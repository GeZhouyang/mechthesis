abstract = "An immersed boundary method (IBM) with second-order spatial accuracy is presented for fully resolved simulations of incompressible viscous flows laden with rigid particles. The method is based on the computationally efficient direct-forcing method of Uhlmann [M. Uhlmann, An immersed boundary method with direct forcing for simulation of particulate flows, J. Comput. Phys. 209 (2005) 448–476] that is embedded in a finite-volume/pressure-correction method. The IBM consists of two grids: a fixed uniform Eulerian grid for the fluid phase and a uniform Lagrangian grid attached to and moving with the particles. A regularized delta function is used to communicate between the two grids and proved to be effective in suppressing grid locking. Without significant loss of efficiency, the original method is improved by: (1) a better approximation of the no-slip/no-penetration (ns/np) condition on the surface of the particles by a multidirect forcing scheme, (2) a correction for the excess in the effective particle diameter by a slight retraction of the Lagrangian grid from the surface towards the interior of the particles with a fraction of the Eulerian grid spacing, and (3) an enhancement of the numerical stability for particle–fluid mass density ratios near unity by a direct account of the inertia of the fluid contained within the particles. The new IBM contains two new parameters: the number of iterations Ns of the multidirect forcing scheme and the retraction distance rd. The effect of Ns and rd on the accuracy is investigated for five different flows. The results show that rd has a strong influence on the effective particle diameter and little influence on the error in the ns/np condition, while exactly the opposite holds for Ns. A novel finding of this study is the demonstration that rd has a strong influence on the order of grid convergence. It is found that for spheres the choice of rd=0.3Δx yields second-order accuracy compared to first-order accuracy of the original method that corresponds to rd=0. Finally, Ns=2 appears optimal for reducing the error in the ns/np condition and maintaining the computational efficiency of the method."

abstract = "We review non-equilibrium many-body phenomena in ensembles of 2D microfluidic droplets. The system comprises of continuous two-phase flow with disc-shaped droplets driven in a channel, at low Reynolds number of 10−4–10−3. The basic physics is that of an effective potential flow, governed by the 2D Laplace equation, with multiple, static and dynamic, boundaries of the droplets and the walls. The motion of the droplets induces dipolar flow fields, which mediate 1/r2 hydrodynamic interaction between the droplets. Summation of these long-range 2D forces over droplet ensembles converges, in contrast to the divergence of the hydrodynamic forces in 3D. In analogy to electrostatics, the strong effect of boundaries on the equations of motion is calculated by means of image dipoles. We first consider the dynamics of droplets flowing in a 1D crystal, which exhibits unique phonon-like excitations, and a variety of nonlinear instabilities—all stemming from the hydrodynamic interactions. Narrowing the channel results in hydrodynamic screening of the dipolar interactions, which changes salient features of the phonon spectra. Shifting from a 1D ordered crystal to 2D disordered ensemble, the hydrodynamic interactions induce collective density waves and shocks, which are superposed on single-droplet randomized motion and dynamic clustering. These collective modes originate from density–velocity coupling, whose outcome is a 1D Burgers equation. The rich observational phenomenology and the tractable theory render 2D droplet ensembles a suitable table-top system for studying non-equilibrium many-body physics with long-range interactions."

abstract = "Dynamic simulation of pressure-driven flow of a non-neutrally buoyant suspension has been performed by Stokesian Dynamics. Channel flow at zero Reynolds number of a monodisperse non-Brownian suspension of spheres in a monolayer was studied for a range of three parameters: bulk particle area fraction ΦAb dimensionless gravitational parameter B = (U0/〈u〉(Ha)2, and dimensionless channel width Ha. Here, U0 is the Stokes settling velocity of an isolated sphere, 〈u〉 is the mean velocity of the suspension, H is the channel width, and a is the particle radius. From an initially uniform distribution, a range of behavior in the fully-developed flow is observed depending upon the value of B. For small B, shear-induced migration dominates buoyancy effects, and a layer at large ΦA is formed in the center of the channel. For sufficiently strong gravitation, particles settle rapidly to form a concentrated layer that is transported along the bottom of the channel by shearing. At intermediate values of B, shear-induced migration of particles to the center of the channel occurs simultaneously with gravitational settling. In the lower portion of the channel, these fluxes are opposed and lead to nonmonotonic variation of particle fraction, with ΦA increasing away from the lower wall to a maximum near or even above the centerline and then rapidly decreasing, typically vanishing to leave clear fluid adjacent to the upper wall. These results are in qualitative agreement with the small amount of experimental data in the literature on such systems. The flow has been modeled using macroscopic balance equations presented previously; the predictions agree well with simulations."

In the course of the study, we observe spontaneous alignment of droplet pairs, pair exchanges, droplet escape, multiple reflections between walls, i.e., a number of phenomena that have not been reported yet. As a whole, using pairwise far-field dipolar interactions between droplets, along with treating the walls as mirrors, allows to reproduce the observations, even though limitations in the predictability of the model are pointed out in a few cases. From a more practical prospective, the work shows that the behavior of elementary droplet assemblies can be put under acceptable experimental control in a wide variety of situations, a feature potentially interesting for self-assembly, mixing, or transport of particles in microfluidic environments.",

abstract = {The creation of new colloidal materials involves the design of functional building blocks. Here, a microfluidic method for designing building blocks one by one, at high throughput, with a broad range of shapes is introduced. The method exploits a coupling between hydrodynamic interactions and depletion forces that controls the configurational dynamics of droplet clusters traveling in microfluidic channels. Droplet clusters can be solidified in situ with UV. By varying the flow parameters, clusters are prescribed a given size, geometry, chemical and/or magnetic heterogeneities enabling local bonding. Compact structures (chains, triangles, diamonds, tetrahedrons,...) and noncompact structures, such as crosses and T, difficult to obtain with current techniques are produced. Size dispersions are small (2\%) and throughputs are high (30 000 h−1). The work opens a new pathway, based on microfluidics, for designing colloidal building blocks with a potential to enable the creation of new materials.},

Two alternative expressions for the solution, one in terms of infinite integrals and the other in terms of infinite series, are given. The infinite series solution is especially suitable for computation purposes being an exponentially decreasing series. From the series the ``far field'' behaviour is extracted. It is found that a force singularity parallel to the two planes has a far field behaviour of source and image for the parallel components (a two dimensional source doublet of height-dependent strength) whereas the normal component, and all fields due to a force singularity normal to the planes, die out exponentially. Velocity fields are compared with those of the one plane case. An estimate of the influence of the second wall and when its effect can be disregarded is obtained.",

abstract = "An immersed boundary method (IBM) with second-order spatial accuracy is presented for fully resolved simulations of incompressible viscous flows laden with rigid particles. The method is based on the computationally efficient direct-forcing method of Uhlmann [M. Uhlmann, An immersed boundary method with direct forcing for simulation of particulate flows, J. Comput. Phys. 209 (2005) 448–476] that is embedded in a finite-volume/pressure-correction method. The IBM consists of two grids: a fixed uniform Eulerian grid for the fluid phase and a uniform Lagrangian grid attached to and moving with the particles. A regularized delta function is used to communicate between the two grids and proved to be effective in suppressing grid locking. Without significant loss of efficiency, the original method is improved by: (1) a better approximation of the no-slip/no-penetration (ns/np) condition on the surface of the particles by a multidirect forcing scheme, (2) a correction for the excess in the effective particle diameter by a slight retraction of the Lagrangian grid from the surface towards the interior of the particles with a fraction of the Eulerian grid spacing, and (3) an enhancement of the numerical stability for particle–fluid mass density ratios near unity by a direct account of the inertia of the fluid contained within the particles. The new IBM contains two new parameters: the number of iterations Ns of the multidirect forcing scheme and the retraction distance rd. The effect of Ns and rd on the accuracy is investigated for five different flows. The results show that rd has a strong influence on the effective particle diameter and little influence on the error in the ns/np condition, while exactly the opposite holds for Ns. A novel finding of this study is the demonstration that rd has a strong influence on the order of grid convergence. It is found that for spheres the choice of rd=0.3Δx yields second-order accuracy compared to first-order accuracy of the original method that corresponds to rd=0. Finally, Ns=2 appears optimal for reducing the error in the ns/np condition and maintaining the computational efficiency of the method."

abstract = "The form of mean stress tensor in monodisperse emulsions is studied in the second-order approximation with respect to the volume density of the particles, for a number of flows which are of rheological interest. It is shown how the particular features of the two-particle interaction between liquid spheres, especially the non-zero differences between the normal stresses in shear flows, give rise to non-Newtonian properties of the emulsion. We know /1, 2/ that in the case of the second-order approximation with respect to the volume concentration of the suspended disperse pháse the mean stress tensor is expressed in terms of two-particle interactions in a linear velocity field, and of the binary correlation function. The binary function is formed under the action of the macroscopic flow. Specific results, however, were obtained only for suspensions and rigid spheres /1, 2/. The present paper deals with the structural model of fluid spheres of equal radius, with hydrodynamic and “contact” interactions. A number of fundamental deviations from /1/ exist in the case of rheologically strong flows, since drop flocculation-deflocculation processes must be considered (i.e. the formation and disruption of aggregates). A strict analysis is given within the framework of the model, of the effect of these processes on the binary correlation function. A connection between the model of “contact” interaction and the result of the D.L.V.O. theory /3–5/ is considered. Numerical values are obtained for the Trouton viscosity in strong rheologically axisymmetric expanding flows. The differences in normal stresses in a strong shear flow are obtained and an approximate estimate is given for the shear viscosity and compared with experimental data /6/. A method given in /2/ is used to compute the effective viscosity of the emulsion in arbitrary, rheologically weak flows in which Brownian motion predomaintes. Considerable use is made of the exact computational methods and asymptotic representations of hydrodynamic functions determining the pairwise interaction of fluid spheres /7–9/."

abstract  ="In materials science{,} high performance is typically associated with regularity and order{,} while disorder and the presence of defects are assumed to lead to sub-optimal outcomes. This holds for traditional solids such as crystals as well as for many types of nanoscale devices. However{,} there are circumstances where disorder can be harnessed to achieve performance not possible with approaches based on regularity. Recent research has shown opportunities specifically for soft matter. There{,} the phenomenon of jamming leads to unique emergent behavior that enables disordered{,} amorphous systems to switch reversibly between solid-like rigidity and fluid-like plasticity. This makes it possible to envision materials that can change stiffness or even shape adaptively. We review some of the progress in this direction{,} discussing examples where jamming has been explored from micro to macro scales in colloidal systems{,} suspensions{,} granular-materials-enabled soft robotics{,} and architecture. We focus in particular on how the jammed aggregate state can be tailored by controlling particle level properties and discuss very recent ideas that provide an important first step toward actual design of specifically targeted jamming behavior."}

abstract="A gas in between micro- or nanostructures on a submerged superhydrophobic (SHPo) surface allows the liquid on the structures to flow with an effective slip. If large enough, this slippage may entail a drag reduction appreciable for many flow systems. However, the large discrepancies among the slippage levels reported in the literature have led to a widespread misunderstanding on the drag-reducing ability of SHPo surfaces. Today we know that the amount of slip, generally quantified with a slip length, is mainly determined by the structural features of SHPo surfaces, such as the pitch, solid fraction, and pattern type, and further affected by secondary factors, such as the state of the liquid--gas interface. Reviewing the experimental data of laminar flows in the literature comprehensively and comparing them with the theoretical predictions, we provide a global picture of the liquid slip on structured surfaces to assist in rational design of SHPo surfaces for drag reduction. Because the trapped gas, called plastron, vanishes along with its slippage effect in most application conditions, lastly we discuss the recent efforts to prevent its loss. This review is limited to laminar flows, for which the SHPo drag reduction is reasonably well understood.",

Hydrodynamic friction on superhydrophobic substrates providing gas{\textendash}liquid interfaces can potentially be optimized by controlling the interface geometry. Therefore, establishing stable and optimal interfaces is crucial but rather challenging. Here we present unique superhydrophobic microfluidic devices that allow the presence of stable and controllable microbubbles at the boundary of microchannels. We experimentally and numerically examine the effect of microbubble geometry on the slippage at high resolution. The effective slip length is obtained for a wide range of protrusion angles, θ, of the microbubbles into the flow, using a microparticle image velocimetry technique. Our numerical results reveal a maximum effective slip length, corresponding to a 23\% drag reduction at an optimal θ ≈ 10{\textdegree}. In agreement with the simulation results, our measurements correspond to up to 21\% drag reduction when θ is in the range of -2{\textdegree} to 12{\textdegree}. The experimental and numerical results reveal a decrease in slip length with increasing protrusion angles when θ ≳ 10{\textdegree}. Such microfluidic devices with tunable slippage are essential for the amplified interfacial transport of fluids and particles.},

abstract="Nanoscale roughness in combination with surface chemistry modification can achieve large liquid slippage due to entrapment of air pockets in the surface asperities (superhydrophobic Cassie state). However, pressure increase may result in the collapse of the gaseous enclaves into the fully wet Wenzel state, and in the irreversible loss of the desirable superhydrophobic features. In order to explain the subtle effects of pressure, an extensive simulative campaign based on full-atoms molecular dynamics and aimed at reproducing a realistic superhydrophobic system comprising water, solid walls, and hydrophobic coating with octadecyltrichlorosilane is addressed in comparison with a continuum approach. The dramatic impact of pressure on slippage is twofold: on the one hand, it influences the shape of the liquid/vapor interface, thus indirectly affecting the flow. This is a purely geometrical effect well captured in principle by the continuum description. On the other hand, pressure controls the complex interplay between water and hydrophobic chains close to the triple line where it significantly alters the liquid structure, thus modifying apparent slippage. This is an intrinsically atomistic phenomenology that cannot be predicted at the continuum level. The combination of the two effects is found to explain the peculiar response of slippage to the applied pressure at the nanoscale, that may look at first sight in contradiction with most microscale literature results.",

abstract="This article considers Couette and Poiseuille flows past superhydrophobic surfaces containing alternating micro-grooves and ribs aligned longitudinally to the flow. The effects of interface curvature on the effective slip length are quantified for different shear-free fractions and groove--rib spatial periods normalized using the channel height. The numerical results obtained demonstrate the importance of considering interface curvature effects in ascertaining the effective slip length. The effective slip length and performance of longitudinal grooves are compared with those corresponding to transverse grooves, for which analytical results are available for small shear-free fractions and normalized groove--rib periodic spacing. For the same shear-free fraction and interface protrusion angle, the effective slip length corresponding to the Poiseuille flow is found to be strongly affected by the normalized groove--rib spacing, in contrast to the Couette flow. For the Poiseuille flow, when the interface deforms by large protrusion angles into the liquid phase, the effective slip length approaches zero or becomes negative for large values of shear-free fraction and normalized groove--rib spacing due to significant flow blockage effects.",

abstract="This paper presents analytical and numerical results for Poiseuille flow through microtubes patterned with superhydrophobic surfaces which consist of alternative ribs and grooves aligned longitudinally with the flow direction. The superhydrophobic surface prevents the flowing liquid from penetrating the grooves and the liquid--gas interface experiences deformation as a consequence of a pressure difference across the interface. Employing a domain perturbation technique, the effects of a small interface deformation on the effective slip behavior are analytically quantified. For large interface deformations, numerical studies are performed to predict the effects of interface protrusion on the effective slip behavior of the superhydrophobic microtube. Comparisons are made between the effective slip behavior for tube and channel flows patterned with superhydrophobic surfaces containing alternating longitudinal ribs and grooves.",

abstract="This paper presents numerical results pertaining to the effects of interface curvature on the effective slip behavior of Poiseuille flow through microchannels and microtubes containing superhydrophobic surfaces with transverse ribs and grooves. The effects of interface curvature are systematically investigated for different normalized channel heights or tube diameters, shear-free fractions, and flow Reynolds numbers. The numerical results show that in the low Reynolds number Stokes flow regime, when the channel height or tube diameter (normalized using the groove--rib spacing) is sufficiently large, the critical interface protrusion angle at which the effective slip length becomes zero is $\theta$c ≈ 62{\textdegree}--65{\textdegree}, which is independent of the shear-free fraction, flow geometry (channel and tube), and flow driving mechanism. As the normalized channel height or tube diameter is reduced, for a given shear-free fraction, the critical interface protrusion angle $\theta$c decreases. As inertial effects become increasingly dominant corresponding to an increase in Reynolds number, the effective slip length decreases, with the tube flow exhibiting a more pronounced reduction than the channel flow. In addition, for the same corresponding values of shear-free fraction, normalized groove--rib spacing, and interface protrusion angle, longitudinal grooves are found to be consistently superior to transverse grooves in terms of effective slip performance.",

influence a detected slip at the surface. We present two-phase lattice Boltzmann
simulations of a flow over structured surfaces with attached gas bubbles and
demonstrate how the detected slip depends on the pattern geometry, the bulk
pressure, or the shear rate. Since a large slip leads to reduced friction, our results
give assistance in the optimization of microchannel flows for large throughput.}

However, low viscosity ratios between immiscible fluids in contact at an interface and large surface tensions may lead to consistency issues as far as mass conservation is concerned. A simple and effective approach is described to ensure mass conservation at all viscosity ratios and capillary numbers within a standard boundary element framework. Benchmark cases are initially considered demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed technique in satisfying mass conservation, comparing with approaches and other solutions present in the literature. The methodology developed is finally applied to the problem of slippage over superhydrophobic surfaces."

A flat fluid interface moving steadily over a flat solid is modeled with the creeping flow approximation, which turns out to be self-consistent. Adherence is required except at the contact line itself. Though the velocity field appears to be realistic, stresses and viscous dissipation are found to increase without bound at the contact line. The way the hydrodynamic model breaks down suggests that in reality there may be steep gradients, rheological anomalies, and discontinuous processes around the contact line. Slip and the role of long-range forces are explored with the aid of the lubrication flow approximation."

The relation is determined from a micro model based on the phase field method. The micro model performs a steady-state computation in a box around the contact point, with far field data given by the macroscale wall contact angle. The size of the micro box is chosen such that physical diffusive processes around the contact point are fully represented. The contact point velocity is shown to converge with respect to the size of the micro box. The angle–velocity relation determined by the micro model is verified on a parameter setting that can be represented by a full phase field simulation. }

An implicit time stepping with efficient block solvers for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations discretized with Taylor–Hood and augmented Taylor–Hood finite elements is presented. A matrix-free implementation is used that reduces the solution time for the Navier–Stokes system by a factor of approximately three compared to the best matrix-based algorithms. Scalability of the chosen algorithms up to 32,768 cores and a billion degrees of freedom is shown. }

The interface is represented implicitly by the 0.5 level set of a function Φ being a smeared out Heaviside function, i.e., a function being zero on one side of the interface and one on the other. In a transition layer of finite, constant thickness Φ goes smoothly from zero to one. The interface is moved implicitly by the advection of Φ, which is split into two steps. First Φ is advected using a standard numerical method. Then an intermediate step is performed to make sure that the smooth profile of Φ and the thickness of the transition layer is preserved. Both these steps are performed using conservative second order approximations and thus conserving ∫Φ. In this way good conservation of the area bounded by the 0.5 contour of Φ is obtained. Numerical tests shows up to second order accuracy and very good conservation of the area bounded by the interface. The method was also coupled to a Navier–Stokes solver for incompressible two phase flow with surface tension. Results with and without topological changes are presented."
