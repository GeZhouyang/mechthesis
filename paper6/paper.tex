{% Insert summary of the paper here (used in introduction)
   In this paper, we combined two separate simulation methods for a numerical study of the effective slip and robustness of the transverse flows over a liquid-infused surface (LIS). Computationally, we introduced a multiscale numerical framework to model wetting and interfacial flows by solving the Cahn-Hilliard equations within a Stokes system. Physically, we conducted a parametric study of the performance of a LIS, quantified by its effective slip length and potential drainage. Our results indicate that filling fraction is the most sensitive parameter for the effective slip, while more viscous lubricants tend to retain permanently in the surface cavities.

\begin{paperabstract}
\Ge{Motivated by the emerging applications of liquid-infused surfaces (LIS), we study the drag reduction and robustness of transverse flows over two-dimensional microcavities partially filled with an oily lubricant.
Using separate simulations at different scales, characteristic contact line velocities at the fluid-solid intersection are first extracted from nano-scale phase field simulations and then applied to micron-scale two-phase flows, thus introducing a multiscale numerical framework to model the interface displacement and deformation within the cavities. 
As we explore the various effects of the lubricant-to-outer-fluid viscosity ratio $\tilde{\mu}_2/\tilde{\mu}_1$, the capillary number Ca, the static contact angle $\theta_s$, and the filling fraction of the cavity $\delta$, we find that the effective slip is most sensitive to the parameter  $\delta$. The effects of $\tilde{\mu}_2/\tilde{\mu}_1$ and $\theta_s$ are generally intertwined, but weakened if $\delta < 1$.
Moreover, for an initial filling fraction $\delta =0.94$, our results show that the effective slip is nearly independent of the capillary number, when it is small. Further increasing Ca to about $0.01 \tilde{\mu}_1/\tilde{\mu}_2$, we identify a possible failure mode, associated with lubricants draining from the LIS, for $\tilde{\mu}_2/\tilde{\mu}_1 \lesssim 0.1$. Very viscous lubricants (\eg $\tilde{\mu}_2/\tilde{\mu}_1 >1$), on the other hand, are immune to such failure due to their generally larger contact line velocity.}
